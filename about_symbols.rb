  # Methods are internally turned into symbols because it makes them easier to reference buy the interpreter. 
  # It makes sense to turn methods into symbols because 2 different methods never have the same name, so it makes sense to turn each method into an immutable object

  # **Classes are just custom data types**
    # Whenever you create a string, it's creating a new string object from the string class
    # Along with the string itself, it comes with a bunch of methods for manipulating the string, built in
    # These sting methonds didn't come out of thin ait, they're pre-defined funtions in the string class
    # Since any string is an instance of the String Class, that sting inherets all the methods that were defined in the String Class
    # 

  # Object = Instance of a Class

  # THINK ABOUT IT:
  #
  # Why do we convert the list of symbols to strings and then compare
  # against the string value rather than against symbols?
